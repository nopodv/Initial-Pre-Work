// Use bracket notation to find the nth to last character in a string

/* Finds a character that is a specific character before the end of the string.
This uses the index with minus. */
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
