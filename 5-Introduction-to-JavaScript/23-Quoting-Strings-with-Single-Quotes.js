// Quote strings with single quotes

/* Mixing 2 types of quotes is possible as long as they match - so an opening
single quote must end with a single quote, starts double - ends double. This
can be useful in various scenarios.
The direction of a slash, if used, is important. Knowing when to use it can be
helpful to ensure cleaner code (i.e. it's easier to read). */
