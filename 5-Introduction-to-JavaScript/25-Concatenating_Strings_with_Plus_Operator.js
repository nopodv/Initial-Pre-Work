// Concatenate strings with plus operator

/* Adds 2 strings together with the addition operator. The concatenation will
not add spaces, so if two strings need to be added, adding an additional
space is necessary for readability. */
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start." + " This is the end.";
