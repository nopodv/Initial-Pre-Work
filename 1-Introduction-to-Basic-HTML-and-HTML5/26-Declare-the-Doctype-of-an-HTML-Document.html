<!--- Declare doctype

Using a opening tag lets the browser know which html version the page uses.
The html tags acts like bookends, marking the beginning and end of the page.
Additionally, CASE matters for the doctype but not for the "html" part of it. --->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Short heading for empty page</h1>
</html>
